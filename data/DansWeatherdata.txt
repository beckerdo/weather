Dan's Ideas for Weather Data Entities

Data Type Character codes 
   Data identifiers have two char codes.
   First code is item that can be sensed. Second code is unit.
   Weather information
   tf = temperature, fahrenheit, tc = temperature, celsius
   wm = wind speed, mph, wk = wind speed, kph
   wb = wind direction, bearing (0-359) or (N,NNE,NE,ENE,E)
   hp = humidity, percent
   pm = pressure, mm, pi=pressure, inches, a=absolute, r=relative
   ri = rain, inches, rm = rain, millimeters
   sc = snow, cm, si = snow, inches
   vf = visibility, feet vm = visibility, meters
   cp = cloud cover, percent
   cd = cloud cover description (clearn, partly, overcast)
   lc = lightning, count
   df = dewpoint, fahrenheit, dc=celsius (calculated?)
   ll = light, lux, w/m2
   uv = uv index, unit?
   sr = solar radiation, unit?
   et = evapotranspiration, unit?

   Non-weather information
   TimeStamp 
      ts = time stamp, e.g. 2015-02-06-20-19-44
   Location 
      la = location latitude, e.g. 30.415047
      lo = location longitude, e.g. -97.762373
      am = altitude (m), e.g. 860.3, af = altitude (ft.), e.g. 860.3
   Author
      ai = author initials, text, e.g. DOB
      an = author name, text, e.g. Dan Becker
   Device
      did = device id
	  tid = type id - computer (database server, web), sensor, tx/rx
   Voltage/Current/Resistance/Capacity/Flux

Data Modeling
   English grammar structure 	ER structure				Shape
   Common noun 					Entity type					Rectangle
   Proper noun 					Entity						Rectangle
   Transitive verb 				Relationship type			Diamond
   Intransitive verb 			Attribute type				Ellipse
   Adjective 					Attribute for entity	  	Ellipse
   Adverb 						Attribute for relationship	Ellipse

Cardinality - Crow's Foot Notation
   || 		One mandatory (exactly one)
   |<		Many mandatory (one or more)
   O|		One optional (zero or one)
   O<		Many optional (zero, one, or more)

Data Type Adjectives
   A third character can be added to a data code to indicate a map/filter/reduce adjective.
   a = average
   h = high
   l = low
   Example: Temperature, fahrenheit, high or low tfh=81.2, tfl=59.8
   
File paths and names 
   Store files in data directory.
   Files and paths can have multiple sub directories.
   Any path can have a file common.txt, listing common data for path subtree, for example time, station 
   Directory path names can also show common data, for example by time, station, lat/lon.
   Use file system friendly characters.
   Each file has timestamp (down to hh:mm:ss), transmitter station name, lat/lon.
   For example 2015-02-06_20-19-44_wt01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt
   When file or path common data has XXs or missing values in name, it means value data will fill in missing wildcards.

Sample files data
   Data sample consists of key and value. Key/value delimiter is "=". Example: tf=67.2
   Multiple samples separated by the "," delimiter. Example: wm=7.2,wb=8
   If "," is not file name safe, use the "_" delimiter.
   When common data, directory path, or file name has missing data or wild cards, data from
      a line can be resolved into the wild cards to fully resolve the data sample.
      For example if the directory path is labeled ts=2015-02-xx_xx-xx ot ts=2015-02, the
      following example lines can help fully resolve the data sample:
   Example file lines complete the timestamp: 
      ts=2015-02-06_20-19-44,wm=8.6,wb=10
      ts=2015-02-06_20-19-45,wm=7.0,wb=8,tf=67.1
      ts=2015-02-06_20-19-46,wm=7.2,wb=12
      ts=2015-02-07_20-19-47,wm=7,8,wb=15
      ts=2015-02-07_20-19-48,wm=8.6,wb=10
      ts=2015-02-07_20-19-49,wm=7.4,wb=8
      ts=2015-02-07_20-19-50,wm=7.1,wb=4,tf=67.6
	  
Samples can be bubbled up into summaries/aggregations
   The file name should have wild card chars or omissions to show aggregation.

   Instantaneous sample from one station, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-19-44_tr01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Multiple samples for one minute from one station, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-19-xx_tr01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Multiple samples for one hour from one station, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-xx-xx_tr01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Multiple samples for one hour from multiple stations, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-xx-xx_xxxx_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Year's samples from multiple stations, one place.
   2015-xx-xx_xx-xx-xx_xxxx_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Daily samples from multiple stations, certain radius of a place.
   2015-02-06_xx-xx-xx_xxxx_30.4xxxxx_-97.7xxxxx.txt

Data Transformations
   Data sample sets should support Map, Filter, Reduce
   Mapping
     Example, map tf to tc (temp fahrenheit to temp celsius)
	 Example, map wm to wk (wind mph to wind kph)
   Filter
     Example, pull just temperature data, pull just one station data, pull author name.
   Reduce
     Convert mulitple samples to reduced sample
     Example: from a sample set, calculate average, high, low
