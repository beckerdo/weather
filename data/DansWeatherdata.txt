Dan's idea for weather data entities

Data Type Character codes 
   Data identifiers have two char codes.
   First code is item that can be sensed. Second code is unit.
   Weather information
   tf = temperature, fahrenheit
   tc = temperature, celsius
   wm = wind speed, mph
   wk = wind speed, kph
   wb = wind direction, bearing (0-359) or (N,NNE,NE,ENE,E)
   hp = humidity, percent
   pm = pressure, mm
   ri = rain, inches
   rm = rain, millimeters
   si = snow, inches
   vf = visibility, feet
   vm = visibility, meters
   cp = cloud cover, percent
   cd = cloud cover description (clearn, partly, overcast)
   lc = lightning, count
   df = dewpoint, fahrenheit, (calculated?)
   ll = light, lux
   uv = uv index, unit?
   sr = solar radiation, unit?
   et = evapotranspiration, unit?
   Non-weather information
   ts = time stamp, e.g. 2015-02-06_20-19-44
   la = location latitude, e.g. 30.415064
   lo = location longiture, e.g. -97.762424
   Meta data
   wt = weather station code text, transmit or receive, e.g. wt01, wt02
   ai = author initials, text, e.g. DOB
   an = author name, text, e.g. Dan Becker

Data Type Adjectives
   A third character can be added to a data code to indicate an adjective.
   a = average
   h = high
   l = low
   Example: Temperature, fahrenheit, high or low tfh=81.2, tfl=59.8
   
File paths and names 
   Store files in data directory.
   Data directory can have multiple sub directories.
   Sub directory names show aggregation, for example by time, station, lat/lon.
   Use file system friendly characters.
   Each file has timestamp (down to hh:mm:ss), transmitter station name, lat/lon.
   For example 2015-02-06_20-19-44_wt01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

Sample files data
   Data sample consists of key and value. Key/value delimiter is "=". Example: tf=67.2
   Multiple samples separated by the "," delimiter. Example: wm=7.2,wb=8
   If "," is not file name safe, use the "_" delimiter.
   With more than one line, line should begin with differentiator (usually time, station, or place)
   Differentiator prefix is delimited by ":" delimiter.
   If no differentiator, the line assume the data from the file name.
   Example file lines from a 2015-02-06-20-19-xx_: 
      2015-02-06_20-19-44:wm=8.6,wb=10
      2015-02-06_20-19-45:wm=7.0,wb=8,tf=67.1
      2015-02-06_20-19-46:wm=7.2,wb=12
      2015-02-06_20-19-47:wm=7,8,wb=15
      2015-02-06_20-19-48:wm=8.6,wb=10
      2015-02-06_20-19-49:wm=7.4,wb=8
      2015-02-06_20-19-50:wm=7.1,wb=4,tf=67.6
	  
Samples can be bubbled up into summaries/aggregations
   The file name should have wild card chars or omissions to show aggregation.

   Instantaneous sample from one station, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-19-44_tr01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Multiple samples for one minute from one station, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-19-xx_tr01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Multiple samples for one hour from one station, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-xx-xx_tr01_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Multiple samples for one hour from multiple stations, one place.
   2015-02-06_20-xx-xx_xxxx_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Year's samples from multiple stations, one place.
   2015-xx-xx_xx-xx-xx_xxxx_30.415064_-97.762424.txt

   Daily samples from multiple stations, certain radius of a place.
   2015-02-06_xx-xx-xx_xxxx_30.4xxxxx_-97.7xxxxx.txt

Data Transformations
   Data sample sets should support Map, Filter, Reduce
   Mapping
     Example, map tf to tc (temp fahrenheit to temp celsius)
	 Example, map wm to wk (wind mph to wind kph)
   Filter
     Example, pull just temperature data, pull just one station data, pull author name.
   Reduce
     Convert mulitple samples to reduced sample
     Example: from a sample set, calculate average, high, low
